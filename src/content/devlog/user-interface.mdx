<Section
  title="Elements">
  UI Elements are composed into a parent child structure, all Elements inherit from a base class providing all their shared functionality,
  and allowing for polymophic structuring.
  Elements include:
    - Text
    - Image
    - Button
    - Panel
    - TextInput
    - ScollPanel
    - VerticalGroup
    - HorizontalGroup
    - GridGroup
    - View
</Section>
<Section
  title="Layouts">
  A UI Layout is defined in xml because xml is ideal for structured data.
  Layouts define everything about ui elements aside from their local actions.
  Layouts are parsed by a factory.

<Section title="Views" image="/astro-portfolio//images/ui-diagram.png">
  A View’s primary resource is its layout.
  A View consumes a layout definition to construct a fixed substructure of UI elements, forming a self-contained interface hierarchy.
  Views may be configured as full-screen or constrained to a specific size. When a View is scaled, any sub-element using anchor-based 
  positioning automatically adjusts its position to maintain alignment relative to its anchor.
  Because a View inherits from Element, it participates fully in the element hierarchy. Views can be stacked, nested, and positioned 
  relative to one another while preserving their internal structure.
  Views expose lookup access to their lineage, allowing composed or project-specific systems to reference elements by identifier. 
  This enables predefined UI structures to be manipulated at runtime—for example:
  - **Assigning local actions to buttons**
  - **Populating scroll views with dynamic content**
  - **Updating text, state, or visibility without reconstructing the layout**
  This approach keeps UI structure declarative and stable, while allowing behavior and data to be injected dynamically by higher-level systems.
